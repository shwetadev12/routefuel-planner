#  Fuel Route Optimization API (Django)

##  Overview

This project is a Django REST API that:

- Accepts a start and end location (within USA)
- Generates a driving route using a free routing API (OSRM)
- Determines the most cost-effective fuel stops along the route
- Simulates realistic fuel consumption
- Calculates total fuel cost
- Returns route geometry for map rendering

The vehicle assumptions:

- Mileage: **10 MPG**
- Tank Capacity: **50 gallons**
- Maximum Range: **500 miles**
- Initial Fuel: **Full Tank (50 gallons)**

The system uses a realistic fuel state simulation engine to determine optimal stops.
